# Enhancing Dependabot Auto-Merging: A Smarter, More Secure Approach

![A shield floating in front of some code snippets](enhancing-dependabot-auto-merging.webp)

Did you know that [outdated dependencies account for up to 68% of vulnerabilities in JavaScript applications](https://moldstud.com/articles/p-understanding-nodejs-security-common-vulnerabilities-and-prevention-strategies)?

In the past, I shared [a method that leveraged GitHub Dependabot, Semantic Release, and automated workflows to streamline dependency updates](https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/how-to-leverage-github-and-semantic-release-to-reduce-vulnerabilities-in-your-packages-c517403e339c) while ensuring new versions were published seamlessly.

While effective, the approach had a few flaws — particularly regarding branch protection and the necessity of personal access tokens (PATs) for auto-merging. Since then, two major improvements have reshaped how I handle these updates: **[GitHub Rulesets](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/about-rulesets)** and a **GitHub App-Based Workflow**. Let’s dive into the evolution of this method and explore how these changes simplify and secure the process.

## Recap: The Old Workflow & Its Drawbacks

My original workflow automated dependency updates via Dependabot PRs, auto-merging them, and triggering Semantic Release to publish new versions. However, several concerns arose:

- **Requiring a Personal Access Token (PAT):** In repositories enforcing review requirements, merging automatically required a PAT from a code owner, as specified in branch protection rules.
- **Branch Protection Limitations with GitHub Apps:** Since GitHub Apps **cannot be assigned as code owners**, repositories using an app secret instead of a PAT for automation had to **entirely bypass branch protection**, as partial bypass was not possible.
  These constraints made the process riskier and harder to scale securely, leading to a need for a more refined approach

## Improvement: GitHub Rulesets for Smarter Branch Protection

GitHub introduced **Rulesets**, a modular way to configure branch protection. The flexibility of rulesets allows for a **dedicated account** to bypass review requirements **only for Dependabot PRs**, while still enforcing other checks like:

- <span class="emoji" aria-hidden="true">
  	✅
  </span>
  Ensuring all status checks pass before merging
- <span class="emoji" aria-hidden="true">
  	✅
  </span>
  Keeping strict protections for other contributors

This granular approach made it possible to replace the PAT through a GitHub App secret and use an [Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/create-github-app-token) to generate a token on the fly to merge the PRs.

While more secure, this solution just traded PAT management for app secret management, providing no improvement in that matter.

## The Solution: A Webhook-Triggered GitHub App

Instead of merely using an app for authentication, I implemented an **app-driven auto-merging solution** that operates via webhooks:

1. The app **triggers a webhook** on PR changes and workflow runs.
2. The webhook **fetches metadata** using GitHub’s GraphQL API.
3. It evaluates the PR using Dependabot’s own [fetch-metadata](https://github.com/dependabot/fetch-metadata) logic.
4. If all checks pass, the webhook **merges the PR automatically**.

## Why This Approach Works Best

- <span class="emoji" aria-hidden="true">
  	🚀
  </span>
  **Simple Deployment:** Installing the app takes just **two clicks**, eliminating the overhead of secret management.
- <span class="emoji" aria-hidden="true">
  	🔒
  </span>
  **No More PATs:** The webhook **generates a temporary installation token** dynamically for each request — enhancing
  security and automation.
- <span class="emoji" aria-hidden="true">
  	🎯
  </span>
  **Single point of improvement:** The code for the app is maintained in a central repository making it much easier to
  improve than multiple copies of the same workflow.

## Conclusion

By leveraging **GitHub Rulesets** and a **Webhook-Triggered GitHub App**, auto-merging Dependabot PRs is now **safer, more scalable, and easier to deploy**. These enhancements **remove security risks and maintenance efforts** and ensure continuous updates without exposing sensitive credentials.

Want to try this approach for your repositories? Start by setting up a GitHub App and optimizing your branch protection rules — automation has never been this effortless.
