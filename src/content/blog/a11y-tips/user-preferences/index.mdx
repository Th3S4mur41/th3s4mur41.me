# User Preferences

A few days ago, a post on LinkedIn nudged me into writing something I’ve been meaning to cover for a while: user preferences. Not just reduced motion, but the entire set of preferences modern browsers expose to us as developers — signals that tell us something about how a user wants or needs to experience the web.
These preferences aren’t decorative.
For some people, they’re the difference between being able to use an interface or abandoning it entirely. For others, they’re simply a matter of comfort or convenience. But in every case, they represent a deliberate choice the user made about how they want their device — and by extension, your app — to behave.
Respecting those choices isn’t optional. It’s part of building for real humans.
And respecting them doesn’t mean throwing your design vision out the window. It means making that vision flexible enough to adapt. In the same way responsive design adapts to different screen sizes and environments, preference‑based design adapts to different user needs and expectations. It’s still your design — just more resilient, more thoughtful, and more inclusive.
In this post, I want to walk through the user preferences available today, explain why each one matters, and share how to use them in a way that enhances your product rather than restricting it. When we get to prefers-reduced-motion, I’ll reference the LinkedIn post that sparked this whole deep dive.
Because at the end of the day, accessibility isn’t about limiting creativity.
It’s about designing with enough intention that your work can meet people where they are.
