# Making Scrollable Code Blocks Accessible

When you work on the web long enough, you get used to browsers disagreeing on the small things. But sometimes those “small things” quietly break accessibility in ways that aren’t obvious until you test with a keyboard.
This is exactly what happened with scrollable `<pre>` elements.
Most browsers — Chrome and Firefox — automatically make scrollable regions keyboard‑focusable. That means if a code block overflows, a keyboard user can tab into it and scroll through the content using the arrow keys. It’s intuitive, consistent, and aligns with WCAG’s requirement that scrollable regions must be keyboard accessible.
Safari, however, doesn’t follow this behavior.


## The Problem: Safari Doesn’t Focus Scrollable `<pre>` Elements

In Safari, a `<pre>` element that becomes scrollable (e.g., long code snippets) does not receive focus by default. That means:
- You can see the scrollbar.
- You can scroll with a mouse or trackpad.
- But you cannot tab into it.
- And therefore you cannot scroll it using the keyboard.
This is a direct accessibility failure under WCAG 2.2’s Keyboard criterion, which states that all functionality must be operable through a keyboard interface — including scrolling inside overflow regions.
For keyboard‑only users, this effectively traps content. They can see the beginning of the code block, but not the rest.
And because Chrome and Firefox “do the right thing,” most developers never notice the issue.

## Why This Matters More Than It Seems

Scrollable code blocks are everywhere:
- Documentation sites
- Developer blogs
- Design system pages
- API references
- Tutorials
If a user can’t scroll them, they can’t read them. And if they can’t read them, the content might as well not exist.
This is one of those accessibility issues that isn’t flashy, but has a real impact on real people.

## The Polyfill: Automatically Adding tabindex="0" When Needed

To fix this gap, I created a small polyfill:
👉 scroll-focus-polyfill
https://github.com/Th3S4mur41/scroll-focus-polyfill
The idea is simple:
- Detect when a `<pre>` element becomes scrollable.
- Automatically add `tabindex="0"` so it becomes keyboard-focusable.
- Only apply this in Safari, where the behavior is missing.
This keeps the behavior consistent across browsers without forcing developers to manually annotate every code block.
It’s intentionally lightweight, unobtrusive, and standards‑aligned.

### Why Not Just Add `tabindex="0"` Everywhere?

You could, but that introduces its own problems:
- Non‑scrollable `<pre>` elements don’t need to be in the tab order.
- Adding unnecessary focus targets creates noise for keyboard users.
- It also breaks expected semantics — not every `<pre>` is interactive.
The polyfill only applies focusability when it’s actually needed.

### A Subtle Bug With Real Accessibility Impact

This is a great example of how accessibility issues often hide in the details. Safari’s behavior isn’t “wrong” in a spec sense — but it’s inconsistent with user expectations and with other browsers’ accessibility affordances.
And because developers rarely test keyboard navigation in Safari, the issue slips through unnoticed.
The polyfill bridges that gap until Safari aligns with the behavior of other engines.
