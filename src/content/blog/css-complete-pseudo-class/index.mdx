# From Skeletons to Smooth Reveals: A Case for the `:complete` pseudo-class

![The CSS logo in front of a skeleton UI template](css-complete-pseudo-class.jpg)

**Ever had a skeleton loader refuse to disappear, lingering like an uninvited guest under your freshly loaded image?** If you've worked with transparent PNGs or avatars, you know the pain: placeholders, initials, or shimmer effects that keep showing through long after the content is ready.

Today, CSS has no way to tell, "Hey, this image is fully here - style it differently now." We patch over the gap with JavaScript listeners and class toggles, but that's a lot of moving parts for what should be a single, declarative rule.

The following code snippet adds listeners in JavaScript to add a class "complete" when the image finished loading successfully or remove it when it didn't.
const img = card.querySelector('img');

```js
img.addEventListener('load', () => {
	card.classList.add('complete');
});
img.addEventListener('error', () => {
	card.classList.remove('complete');
});
```

Imagine a native pseudo‑class  - ` :complete` - that fires the instant an image (or any replaced element) successfully renders. One line of CSS to swap a skeleton for the real deal. No extra scripts. No race conditions. Just cleaner, more accessible, more performant design.

> It's time we stopped hacking around a missing feature and started building a web where "complete" is a first‑class citizen.

## The current State

### Skeleton loaders

Skeletons have become the go‑to pattern for avoiding the dreaded "content jump". Instead of a blank box, you render a gray placeholder shaped like the final content. The problem: CSS has no built‑in way to know when to swap it out for the real image.

1. You attach a `load` event listener in JavaScript.
2. On success, JS toggles a class, e.g., `.complete`.
3. CSS picks up that class to fade out the skeleton.

```css
img.complete {
	background: none; /* clear fallback */
}
```

This means every skeleton loader ships with extra script, DOM manipulation, and sometimes messy race‑condition handling. Without JS, the skeleton just sits there indefinitely.

### Avatars with Transparent PNGs

User profile pictures often come in as transparent PNGs. The standard fallback is to show initials, a colored background, or an icon behind the avatar.

<figure>
	<Image
		src={avatarExample}
		alt="The left and center avatars appear as expected. On the left, there's a colored fallback displaying initials, while the center shows an image with a solid background. The issue arises with the right avatar: when the image has a transparent background, the fallback initials remain visible underneath, creating an unintended visual overlap."
	/>
	<figcaption>
		The left and center avatars appear as expected. On the left, there's a colored fallback displaying initials, while
		the center shows an image with a solid background. The issue arises with the right avatar: when the image has a
		transparent background, the fallback initials remain visible underneath, creating an unintended visual overlap.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

**The hitch**: CSS can't tell that the transparent PNG has fully loaded - so the fallback bleeds through unless you hide it manually with JS.

1. You watch for the `load` event.
2. Swap `background-color `or `background-image` to `none`.
3. If the image fails, you need an error handler to restore the fallback.

```css
.avatar:has(img.complete) {
	background: white; /* use a more discreet background */
	color: transparent; /* hide the initials */
}
```

It's a fragile dance: JS does all the state‑tracking because CSS is essentially "blind" to whether an image exists in memory yet.

## Why This Matters

Both cases are solved today with JavaScript event plumbing, even though the **state we care about is purely presentational**. A native pseudo‑class like `:complete` would let CSS take full responsibility:

```css
img:complete {
	background: none; /* clear fallback */
}
.avatar:has(img:complete) {
	background: white; /* use a more discreet background */
	color: transparent; /* hide the initials */
}
```

No listener cleanup. No manual class toggles. Just declarative, resilient styling tied directly to the resource state.

### State Selectors for the Win - Adding :loaded to the set

Just like `:playing` and `:muted` let CSS react to the runtime state of media elements, `:complete` would expose a similarly dynamic hook - but for images and other replaced elements.
Where `:playing` styles a `<video>` in motion and `:muted` adapts its UI when sound is off, `:complete` would style elements the moment their resource is fully ready to render. 

All three share the same philosophy: **declare visual changes in pure CSS, directly from the element's state, without bolting on JavaScript plumbing.**

## Conclusion - Let's Make `:complete` Happen

We've lived too long in a world where CSS can't natively respond to an image that's simply… ready. Skeletons, fallbacks, and low‑quality placeholders all suffer from the same gap: the browser knows the resource is loaded, but CSS can't act on that knowledge without JavaScript as a middle‑man.

The fix isn't hypothetical - the CSS Working Group is already discussing a broader set of [resource‑state pseudo‑classes](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/3134) like `:loading`, `:partial`, `:complete`, and `:broken`. Those fit naturally into the pseudo-class family, giving us a declarative, accessible, and performant way to handle one of the most common UI states on the web.

**If you believe this belongs in the platform, now's the time to speak up.** Share your use cases, add your voice, and help shape the spec by joining the conversation on the CSSWG's ["Pseudo‑classes for image state" issue](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/3134). Every real‑world example strengthens the case - and brings us closer to a web where "complete" is just another state CSS can style.

## Update

After publishing the post, [Bramus Van Damme](https://bsky.app/profile/bram.us) pointed me to the ongoing [CSSWG discussion on resource state pseudo-classes](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/7467).

While my original post referred to a hypothetical `:complete` pseudo-class—based on earlier GitHub discussions and the class I’ve been manually toggling via JavaScript—the current proposal introduces `:loading` and `:failed` instead.
These two could potentially cover the same use cases, albeit with slightly more verbose selectors like:

```css
img:not(:failed):not(:loading) {
	/* image has successfully loaded */
}
```

This tradeoff might be acceptable to avoid redundant pseudo-classes, but only the spec sticks to just those two states.  
However, if additional pseudo-classes like `:stalled`, `:pending`, or `:delayed` are introduced—as some commenters have suggested—the absence of a unified `:complete` or `:loaded` state might lead to increasingly complex selectors:

```css
img:not(:failed):not(:loading):not(:pending):not(:stalled) {
	/* image is fully loaded and visible */
}
```

In such scenarios, a dedicated `:complete` pseudo-class could regain relevance for clarity and maintainability.

What are your thoughts? Would you prefer the simplicity of a `:complete` pseudo-class, or do you find the current proposal sufficient?
